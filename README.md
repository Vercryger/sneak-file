## Commit Messages

To ensure that all contributors follow the correct message convention, each time you commit your message will be validated with the [commitlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli) package, enabled by the [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) Git hooks manager.

Examples of commit messages: https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release

## Publication to NPM

The `@sneak-file` package is automatically published by CI when commits are merged or pushed to the `master` branch. This is done using [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release), which also determines version bumps based on conventional Git commit messages.

## Developer Certificate of Origin
We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) in lieu of a Contributor License Agreement for all contributions to this project. We request that contributors agree to the terms of the DCO and indicate that agreement by signing-off all commits made by adding a line with your name and email address to every Git commit message contributed:
```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

You can sign-off your commit automatically with Git by using `git commit -s` if you have your `user.name` and `user.email` set as part of your Git configuration.

We ask that you use your real full name (please no anonymous contributions or pseudonyms) and a real email address. By signing-off your commit you are certifying that you have the right to submit it under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).

We use the [Probot DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to check for DCO sign-offs of every commit.

If you forget to sign-off your commits, the DCO bot will remind you and give you detailed instructions for how to amend your commits to add a signature.
